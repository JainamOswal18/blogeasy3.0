# Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **BlogEasy 3.0** – a simple yet functional blogging platform where users can write and view blogs.  

## 📝 About BlogEasy  
This project is a **basic blog web application** designed to provide a seamless blogging experience. Currently, blogs are stored temporarily and will get deleted once the session expires. However, I plan to enhance the application soon by adding **database functionality** for persistent storage.  

> I'm **open to collaboration**! If you have ideas or want to contribute, feel free to jump in!
